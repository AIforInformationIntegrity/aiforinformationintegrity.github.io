excerpt:  From echo chamber to public square, online environments are full of political discussion and conflict. We aim to measure and understand the evolving discourse, and ultimately, how it shapes our beliefs.

Our research on ideology and polarization explores how digital platforms amplify partisan divides and shape political discourse across societal contexts. It focuses on understanding the expression, measurement, and impact of ideological differences in shaping public opinion, both within and across linguistic and cultural boundaries. This area highlights the interplay between technology, political behavior, and societal cohesion in an increasingly interconnected world.
